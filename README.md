# Challenge-

## **Pandas and Matplotlib helps us a lot in exploration of statistical data. Participate in this week's challenge to prove your proficiency in them.**

**About the challenge:** 

Your friends are doing a group research to find out if there's any relationship between the average number of hours a student studies everyday vs the marks they get. For this, they collected data of 200 random students across the school via survey forms. Very much as expected, many students took it lightly and gave incorrect data. Because of this, they're unable to find an easy way out to solve this issue.
Its your time to help your friends with the knowledge of Python programming. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a random dataset having details of 200 students with columns for Average percentage and Average hours studied in a day. 
2. Fill random entries in the dataset and put some error values too like Average percentage less than 0 or greater than100, Hours studied less than 0 or greater than 10.

3. Use pre-defined functions from Pandas package to remove entries having erroneous data. 
4. Plot a line graph and a scatter plot to find out the relation between the parameters.
5. Print the conclusion of your observation as the final output of your code.

## Installation and Requirements
 
### Windows and Mac  Users-

- Visit the [Python](https://python.org) website and download your preferred python version. (Here, Python 3.8.8 is recommended)

- Make sure Python is added to PATH 

- Download the [project zip file](https://github.com/arghyagod-coder/PlottingStudentsData) and extract it in a folder

- Open the directory through Powershell (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) and follow the commands-

*Windows -*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Mac-*

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux users-

- Linux disros usually have python installed in them, but if not, you can alternatively do it

*Ubuntu and Derivatives-*

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3.8
$ sudo apt install python-pip3
```
Check your installations by running both `python3 -V` and `pip3 -V` in terminal, and if both return versions, congratulations, you installed python successfully

- Now Download the project zip file and extract it to a location

- Run:

```
cd location; pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Now you can run the python file in a code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.org), [Sublime Text 3 ](https://sublimetext.com/3), [Thonny](https://thonny.org), [PyCharm](https://jetbrains.com/pycharm) etc.)

## Usage

Open your shell/powershell/terminal:

```
cd /home/username/Desktop/Folder
python3 main.py
```

Replace 'username' with your home user name, and replace the directory with your current directory

ENJOY THE PROGRAM!
